# Improving the Coding Experience on CSDN with a Chrome Extension

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_cn.md)

## Introduction

As a front-end developer who contributes to open source projects, I noticed there is room for improvement in code reading experience on the official CSDN website. Leveraging my rich experience in front-end development, I developed this extension to help developers browse and learn CSDN articles more efficiently.

## Features

- One-click expand all code blocks: No need to expand manually to view code fully
- Intelligent code copying: Seamlessly copy code snippets to editors
- Login-free: In line with CSDN's open spirit, no login required to use the extension

## Local Installation and Use

Clone this repo. Go to `chrome://extensions` to access Extensions page. Enable Developer mode and select Load Unpacked Extension to install from project folder. Refer to [Chrome Extension Development Guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions?hl=zh-cn) for more details on Chrome extension development.
